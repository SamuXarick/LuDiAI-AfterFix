/**
 * An AyStar implementation.
 *  It solves graphs by finding the fastest route from one point to the other.
 *
 *  AyStar differences to Graph.AyStar 6:
 *  - Uses a different, faster queue.
 *  - Source tiles are an array of tiles in the form [tile, direction, used_tiles].
 *    The used_tiles is added, and is another array of tiles in the form [tile, bitmask].
 *  - Goal tiles are a simple array of tiles, no longer in the form [tile, next_tile], just 'tile'.
 *
 *  AyStar.Path differences to Graph.AyStar 6:
 *  - _length is removed for improved performance.
 *  - _used_tiles is added. It works as a cumulative cache, consisting of an array of used tiles
 *    up to the current point in the path. Improves performance in relation to the Graph.AyStar 6
 *    compatible version, which requires to walk the path backwards each time, to recompute them.
 *    Requires a small portion of memory.
 *  - _path_tiles is added. It works as a cumulative cache, consisting of an array of tiles that
 *    the path consists off, from the beginning up to the current point in the path. Improves
 *    performance of AyStar class when checking for a possible collision, which requires to walk
 *    the path backwards. Requires a large portion of memory.

	 *  new_node is the new node that is added to that path. It should return
	 *  the cost of the path including new_node.
	 * @param estimate_callback A function that returns an estimate from a node
	 *  to the goal node. It should accept four parameters, tile, direction,
	 *  goal_nodes and estimate_callback_param. It should return an estimate to
	 *  the cost from the lowest cost between node and any node out of goal_nodes.
	 *  Note that this estimate is not allowed to be higher than the real cost
	 *  between node and any of goal_nodes. A lower value is fine, however the
	 *  closer it is to the real value, the better the performance.
	 * @param neighbours_callback A function that returns all neighbouring nodes
	 *  from a given node. It should accept three parameters, current_path, node
	 *  and neighbours_callback_param. It should return an array containing all
	 *  neighbouring nodes, which are an array in the form [tile, direction, used_tiles].

	 *  true. It should accept four parameters, tile, existing_direction,
	 *  new_direction and check_direction_callback_param. It should check
	 *  if both directions can go together on a single tile.
