LuDiAI AfterFix
===============

v11 (08-04-2019)
- Failure to detect a 2 tile sized tunnel or bridge was preventing road
  construction
- "Minimum distance between towns for road routes" setting has a random
  deviation of 15

v10 (27-03-2019)
- Fixed a crash that could occur when attempting to sell a road vehicle
- Avoid using valuators when looking for a suitable airport location

v9 (21-02-2019)
- Fixed a bug that caused aircraft to be in the wrong group

v8 (17-02-2019)
- Added SCP support for Company Value GS
- Added vehicle groups for routes
- Reworked send to depot code with recourse to two special groups for the
  effect
- Added shared orders support for vehicles
- Several optimizations were done to increase vehicle and route management
  speeds
- Initiates small, medium and large advertising campaigns
- Funds construction of new buildings in towns
- Reevaluated pathfinder number of tries so that it doesn't take more
  or less time than necessary to find a path
- Fixed a bug that caused towns founded by others than self to go
  unnoticed by the town manager for road routes
- Renew aircraft when a better engine model becomes available
- Fixed a bug that caused incomplete removal of road vehicle routes. Their
  removal is now scheduled instead

v7 (22-12-2018)
- Fixed a crash when founding a town

v6 (22-12-2018)
- Added 3 new settings:
- "Minimum distance between towns for road routes", which was always 40 in
  previous versions
- "Road pathfinder profile", which was "Custom" in the previous version
  and "Default" in even earlier versions. "Fastest" is the newer choice
- "Road route capacity mode", which was always "Maximum of 25 road
  vehicles" in previous versions. "Estimate maximum number of road
  vehicles" and "Adjust number of road vehicles dynamically" are the newer
  choices
- Reworked "Random picks" setting into "Town choice priority", with 4
  options to chose from. "None, pick at random" is the equivalent choice
  if "Random picks" was on, and "Most cargo produced first" is the
  equivalent choice if it was off. "Shorter routes first" and "Longer
  routes first" are the newer choices
- Road route minimum distance takes map size into account
- Changed road route maximum distance to always have a minimum delta
  between it and the minimum distance
- No longer retries to find a nearby town to connect by road with an
  increased maximum distance after failing the first time
- Managing road routes can now be interrupted and continued next cycle
- Account for more road vehicles when estimating costs for building a road
  route
- Save messages are hidden
- The maximum number of pathfinder attempts is now based on distance and 
  profile used. Also reduces duration of each attempt
- The formula used for computing days in transit for a road vehicle was
  wrong and has been fixed
- Prevent road vehicles with incomplete orders from running
- Renew road vehicles when a better engine model becomes available
- Station spread road stations only when it reaches maximum capacity
- Account for at least two aircraft when estimating costs for building an
  air route
- Try to build next air routes with two aircraft minimum, one per airport
- Managing air routes was being denied if "Air Support" is turned off
  while there were air routes
- Builds statues
- Builds company HQ
- Does not change company name upload loading from a savegame
- Founds towns

v5 (29-09-2018)
- OpenTTD and API requirements set to 1.4.0
- Upgrading road vehicles, engines and bridges was being denied once the
  AI had reached the maximum number of vehicles
- Allow road pathfinder to be interrupted and resumed without losing its
  current path finding progress, allowing the AI to manage other things in
  between, by up to 5 times
- Allow pathbuilder to retry construction when failing to build planned
  route roads
- Tweaked pathfinder internal cost values and how they're measured, which
  should result in more bridges and tunnels on difficult terrain, while
  being cost conscious at the same time when on a low budget
- Allow pathfinder to build bridges over rail and rivers in more occasions
- Prevent pathfinder to connect roads with level crossings in most
  situations
- Prevent blocking of road stations of other companies while constructing
  its own road stations
- Allow a few more cases where locations without adjacent roads could be
  suitable for constructing a road station

v4 (18-09-2018)
- There was still some cases where drive through road stations were not
  being built, resulting in vehicles with few orders
- Reduce number of stalls when managing too many road routes, when looking
  for suitable airport and road station locations
- Road vehicle engine model choice is no longer based only on maximum
  speed, but also on capacity, cargo payment, distance of route, days in
  transit and reliability

v3 (16-09-2018)
- When expanding a road station, the counting of articulated road vehicles
  could be incorrect in determining the need of a drivethrough station
- The build manager wasn't setting the articulated variable value at all
- When building or expanding a road station, there could be cases where
  the station wasn't being built at all, resulting in vehicles with few
  orders
- Disabled breakdowns were not being considered on estimating the
  viability of an aircraft engine

v2 (15-09-2018)
- Estimating air route costs could account an incorrect aircraft price
- Helicopter engine list could include invalid and unbuildable models
- Valuator for best aircraft income was using the wrong distance type
- Allow more towns to be searched for a suitable first airport
- Don't start road construction when there are no engines available
- Builds or expands routes with only drivethrough road stations if there's
  only articulated road vehicles
- Increased town's mail last month production lower limit
- Loosened the aircraft income estimator lower limit
- Lowered the bar for what's deemed profitable to an aircraft
