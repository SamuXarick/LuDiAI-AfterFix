v14 (09-03-2020)
- OpenTTD and API requirements set to 1.10.0
- Fixed english typos in the code, readme and changelog
- Road bridge names are no longer reported as rail bridges
- Planning air routes now takes into consideration whether infrastructure
  maintenance costs are enabled or not. It's far from perfect, but the AI
  plans air routes with at least 7 aircraft and try to fully serve it,
  before attempting a new route. It also only considers airports with the
  cheapest maintenance costs that can still support each of the aircraft
  types available. Due to the conservative approach of these changes, the
  AI may not perform as well as before in the very long run, but it should
  be able to have a better start
- Upgrading engines to a better model may be done over time instead of all
  at once, depending on available money
- AI is now able to get the correct capacity of a refited vehicle in most
  situations which should result in better engine choices
- Fixed a bug that caused detection of a suitable tile for a road depot to
  be incorrect
- Fixed a bug in the road pathfinder which in theory should result in a
  better path choice
- Fixed a bug that caused helicopter routes to be created without a hangar
  resulting in no helicopters being built and the route being demolished
  right away
- Reduced the amount of messages about failed air routes caused by low
  funds
- Aircraft routes may now be fully closed if they're not profitable enough
- Tweaked the income formula for aircraft, most noticeable the estimated
  optimal number of days when "Vehicle breakdowns" are set to "Normal". It
  is also able to determine how many aircraft are needed to turn a profit
- Fixed a rare division by zero error that could occur when counting the
  number of vehicles needed for a route
- Town actions, such as building statues, advertising campaigns and
  founding towns, now may only happen when the loan is zero which should
  result in better survivability of the AI
- When looking for a suitable airport location, also take into
  consideration the distance to the center of the town in case of multiple
  spots with the same number of houses nearby

v13 (04-01-2020)
- Fixed a bug that caused the AI to take too long to start
- When chosing a place for an airport, also take mail acceptance into
  consideration when "Town cargo" is set to "Passengers and Mail"

v12 (19-09-2019)
- Reworked all remaining valuators in hope to prevent stalls caused by the
  AI
- Don't terminate a route under plan when in the meanwhile the maximum
  number of road vehicles is reached. Resume it later whenever the limit
  permits it
- Prefer building stations on locations with more houses around while best
  routes are not yet used
- Pathfinder number of tries have been changed to iterations, and is now
  interrupted after more than a day iterating, to be resumed later on
- Custom and fastest pathfinder profiles tweaked to restrict the search
  area into a rectangle, which should improve pathfind total time
- Reworked how breakdowns are taken into consideration. It no longer
  filters out engines from the choice pool. It is now part of the income
  formula
- Added "Road route load orders mode" setting with 3 options to chose
  from: "Full load before departing", "Load something before departing"
  and "May load nothing before departing"
- Changed the way vehicles are added to newly constructed road routes. A
  vehicle is started every few days after the previous one, which should
  end improving cargo rating at the stations
- Only send negative profit road vehicles to depots 30 days after the last
  time a vehicle was added on a route, and after all vehicles have started
  on a new route. Also remove then one at a time
- When renewing road vehicles, remember which order the vehicle was
  running, and skip to it after renewal
- Fixed a bug that happened during jam detection, where the information
  about last time a vehicle was removed was missing
- Road vehicles added to an existing route, via "Adjust number of road
  vehicles dynamically" option, now start to go to whichever station has
  the most cargo waiting, by subtracting the engine capacity each time one
  is added in this manner
- Set group names to road routes and air routes
- Added the ability to select "Passengers and Mail" for "Town cargo"
  setting
- When evaluating towns for possible road and air routes, use a customized
  cargo production rating based on transported percentage for "Most cargo
  produced first" option
- Fixed a bug in "None, pick at random" which was preventing the last two
  available towns to be picked by the randomizer
- Fixed a bug with freeform edges that caused getting the offset of a tile
  to be off by 1
- Fixed a bug when checking for stations nearby, an incorrect radius was
  being applied to the search
- Fixed a bug in getting the first available Passenger or Mail cargo. It
  was, instead, getting the last available ones.
- Fixed a bug on checking wether "distant_join_stations" were on,
  preventing construction of airports and road stations on adjacent
  road stations and airports as separate stations
- Reworked air route plan mode, to be more flexible by allowing it to
  interrupt the search after more than a day iterating suitable locations
  for airports
- Fixed a bug that prevented displaying a message about new air routes
  being successfully built if all planned aircraft weren't built
- Fixed a bug that caused clearing the lists of tried towns in an
  incorrect manner, causing the town search to not finish correctly,
  during 2nd airport construction phase
- Permit building airports with less catchment radius once the best routes
  have been used
- "Minimum distance between towns for road routes" has been removed.
  "Aproximate number of days in transit for road routes" has been added,
  which replaces the old setting. Has a minimum value of 10 and a maximum
  of 150. Note that much higher values increase the pathfinding search to
  unfeasible amounts of time
- Reworked road route management to be more often interrupted, to allow
  the AI perform more of the other tasks
- Allow construction of more road vehicle stations on already serviced
  towns once best routes have been used, or if "None, pick at random" is
  chosen
- Builds all statues first, then advertising campaigns after, and try not
  to advertise as much as before
- Added a workaround for when loading from a savegame, it removes road
  stations or depots that happen to not be registered during save due to
  being in a queue that hasn't finished in time before the save occurred

v11 (08-04-2019)
- Failure to detect a 2 tile sized tunnel or bridge was preventing road
  construction
- "Minimum distance between towns for road routes" setting has a random
  deviation of 15

v10 (27-03-2019)
- Fixed a crash that could occur when attempting to sell a road vehicle
- Avoid using valuators when looking for a suitable airport location

v9 (21-02-2019)

  effect
- Added shared orders support for vehicles
- Several optimizations were done to increase vehicle and route management
  speeds
- Initiates small, medium and large advertising campaigns
- Funds construction of new buildings in towns
- Reevaluated pathfinder number of tries so that it doesn't take more
  or less time than necessary to find a path
- Fixed a bug that caused towns founded by others than self to go
  unnoticed by the town manager for road routes
- Renew aircraft when a better engine model becomes available
- Fixed a bug that caused incomplete removal of road vehicle routes. Their
  removal is now scheduled instead

v7 (22-12-2018)
- Fixed a crash when founding a town

v6 (22-12-2018)
- Added 3 new settings:
- "Minimum distance between towns for road routes", which was always 40 in
  previous versions
- "Road pathfinder profile", which was "Custom" in the previous version
  and "Default" in even earlier versions. "Fastest" is the newer choice
- "Road route capacity mode", which was always "Maximum of 25 road
  vehicles" in previous versions. "Estimate maximum number of road
  vehicles" and "Adjust number of road vehicles dynamically" are the newer
  choices
- Reworked "Random picks" setting into "Town choice priority", with 4
  options to chose from. "None, pick at random" is the equivalent choice
  if "Random picks" was on, and "Most cargo produced first" is the
  equivalent choice if it was off. "Shorter routes first" and "Longer
  routes first" are the newer choices
- Road route minimum distance takes map size into account
- Changed road route maximum distance to always have a minimum delta
  between it and the minimum distance
- No longer retries to find a nearby town to connect by road with an
  increased maximum distance after failing the first time
- Managing road routes can now be interrupted and continued next cycle
- Account for more road vehicles when estimating costs for building a road
  route
- Save messages are hidden
- The maximum number of pathfinder attempts is now based on distance and
  profile used. Also reduces duration of each attempt

- Renew road vehicles when a better engine model becomes available
- Station spread road stations only when it reaches maximum capacity
- Account for at least two aircraft when estimating costs for building an
  air route
- Try to build next air routes with two aircraft minimum, one per airport
- Managing air routes was being denied if "Air Support" is turned off
  while there were air routes
- Builds statues
- Builds company HQ
- Does not change company name upload loading from a savegame
- Founds towns

v5 (29-09-2018)
- OpenTTD and API requirements set to 1.4.0
- Upgrading road vehicles, engines and bridges was being denied once the
  AI had reached the maximum number of vehicles
- Allow road pathfinder to be interrupted and resumed without losing its
  current path finding progress, allowing the AI to manage other things in
  between, by up to 5 times
- Allow pathbuilder to retry construction when failing to build planned
  route roads
- Tweaked pathfinder internal cost values and how they're measured, which
  should result in more bridges and tunnels on difficult terrain, while
  being cost conscious at the same time when on a low budget
- Allow pathfinder to build bridges over rail and rivers in more occasions
- Prevent pathfinder to connect roads with level crossings in most
  situations
- Prevent blocking of road stations of other companies while constructing
  its own road stations
- Allow a few more cases where locations without adjacent roads could be
  suitable for constructing a road station

v4 (18-09-2018)
- There was still some cases where drive through road stations were not
  being built, resulting in vehicles with few orders
- Reduce number of stalls when managing too many road routes, when looking
  for suitable airport and road station locations
- Road vehicle engine model choice is no longer based only on maximum
  speed, but also on capacity, cargo payment, distance of route, days in
  transit and reliability

v3 (16-09-2018)
- When expanding a road station, the counting of articulated road vehicles
  could be incorrect in determining the need of a drivethrough station
- The build manager wasn't setting the articulated variable value at all
- When building or expanding a road station, there could be cases where
  the station wasn't being built at all, resulting in vehicles with few
  orders
- Disabled breakdowns were not being considered on estimating the
  viability of an aircraft engine

v2 (15-09-2018)
- Estimating air route costs could account an incorrect aircraft price
- Helicopter engine list could include invalid and unbuildable models
- Valuator for best aircraft income was using the wrong distance type
